# Membrane Fouling Models for Dead End Mode


The Jupiter Notebook takes in .csv files with two columns (Time and Flux) 
and returns the estimated parameters of the models and an Excel Spreadsheet with 
the corresponding data predicted by the implemented models. 
The fouling models are presented in [this](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0011916411003596?via%3Dihub) paper as equations (4-7).
